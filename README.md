HackMD 0.2.7
===

This is a realtime collaborative markdown notes on all platforms.
But still in early stage, feel free to fork or contribute to it.

Thanks for your using.

The notes are store in PostgreSQL, and I provided the schema in the hackmd_schema.sql.
The users and sessions are store in mongoDB, which don't need schema, so just launch and connect it.
